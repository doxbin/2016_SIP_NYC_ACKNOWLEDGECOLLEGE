  <div class="col-sm-5 col-md-6"><p>I am a high school student who is very passionate about STEM fields. I always knew that I wanted to pursue a technology related field. I love being creative and challenged at the same time. When I was 12 years old I started to teach myself simple programming languages such as HTML, and since then I knew that this was the perfect career path for me. I have designed websites for myself and clubs in school. I'm extremely passionate about computer science and I'm excited to continue pursuing this field. Currently I am pursuing a 7 week program at BlackRock called Girls Who Code</p></div>

  <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-5 offset-md-2 col-lg-6 offset-lg-0"><p>I am a highschool student who fell in love with computer science when I joined a computer science course called Script Ed. In Script Ed, I learned three web development languages, Html, CSS, and Javascript. Additionally I was introduced to an extraordinary program called Girls Who Code. In Girls Who Code, I have learned more programming languages such as C++, Python, and Scratch. In the future, I hope to minor in Computer Science and major in Education.</p></div>

course called Script Ed where I learned web development languages such as html, javascript,and css. This course made me become interested in computer science and introduced me to a fantastic program called Girls Who Code. 
While I participated in the Girs Who Code program, I have learned more about programming languages, which increased my interest for computer science.
 In the future, I plan to pursue a career in the computer science field because of these great programs.
